Reinforcement Learning for Logistics 

Design and implement an algorithm to optimize food delivery rider assignments and routes in 
the city of Lucknow.

Project Overview

The goal is to develop an efficient system that minimizes rider idle time, 
optimizes travel distances, ensures on-time deliveries, and effectively manages multiple 
pickups and drop-offs while adhering to rider capacity constraints.
